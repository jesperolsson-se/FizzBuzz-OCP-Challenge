# FizzBuzz
Toy project for demonstrating one aspect of the Open-Closed Principle, using the
popular programming excercise [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz).

## The basic problem
Simply put, FizzBuzz is a game about division. Taking turns, the players count
the integers. When 3 divides the number, the active player says "Fizz" or
is elimiated. Similarly, numbers divisible by 5 and 15 are, respectively, "Buzz"
and "FizzBuzz". The table below presents the breakdown of the sixteen first
turns of a correctly played FizzBuzz game.

Number | Word
--- | ---
1 | 1
2 | 2
3 | Fizz
4 | 4
5 | Buzz
6 | Fizz
7 | 7
8 | 8
9 | Fizz
10 | Buzz
11 | 11
12 | Fizz
13 | 13
14 | 14
15 | FizzBuzz
16 | 16

Perhaps unsurprisingly, FizzBuzz has grown to become a popular programming
exercise. It's a small, well-defined problem that also hides a couple of caveats
that aren't obvious to everyone at first glance. In fact, FizzBuzz is so popular
that it's shows up in recruitment processes every now and then.
